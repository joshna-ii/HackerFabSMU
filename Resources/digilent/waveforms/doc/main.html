The following two buttons switch between Tabbed and Docking Windows.<br>
The last gear button opens the Application Options.</p>


<p><br></p>

<h3><a name="main.workspace" id="main.workspace"></a>1.3. The Workspace and Project</h3>
<p>The workspace refers to any open instruments and their current state. The workspace can be loaded and saved with the <b>Open</b> and <b>Save/Save As</b> buttons in the WaveForms's Welcome tab. </p>
<p>The workspace and instrument project can be saved in one of the following modes selected by the save filter:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>without acquisition</b>: saves only the Oscilloscope reference channels and data in tabs, Logic Analyzer tabs, custom AWG waveforms, and Pattern Generator custom data.</li>
    <li>with acquisition: also saves all buffered data in Oscilloscope and Logic Analyzer, captures in Spectrum, Network and Impedance Analyzer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The workspace files are associated with WaveForms. When you open a workspace (double-click on a *.dwf3work file) and WaveForms is running, it will be opened with the last used application instance. Otherwise, if WaveForms is not currently running, it will open with a new application instance.</p>
<p>The project refers to an instrument and its current state. The project can be loaded and saved with the Open and Save buttons in each instrument. </p>
<p>The project files are associated with WaveForms. When you open a project (double-click on a *.dwf3scope, *.dwf3wavegen, *dwf3logic, ... file) and WaveForms is running, it will be opened with the last used application instance. Otherwise, if WaveForms is not currently running, it will open with a new application instance.</p>
<p>The <b>New</b> button closes the current project. It can also be used to clear the last settings of the instruments.</p>
<p>The <b>Extract</b>/<b>Compress</b> unpacks the workspace archive. It can be used to extract raw capture data and configuration files.</p>

<p><img src="images/main.shortcuts.png"><img src="images/main.shortcuts2.png"></p>

<h2><a name="main.device" id="main.device"></a>
3. Device Manager</h2>
<p>The Device Manager allows you to select the device and configuration to use with the WaveForms application.</p>
<p>To open the Device Manager, select the Settings / Device Manager menu or click on the window's status bar&nbsp;device button from the WaveForms window. </p>
<p>The <b>Select + Dual</b> button lets you connect to two devices.<br>
- Either to two identical devices to control these at the same time, to double the Scope, Wavegen and DIO channels. The Trigger IOs will be used to synchronize the device.<br>
The reference clock option is available with ADP3X50 and Analog Discovery 3. The clock phase may need to be adjusted for stable triggering which is affected by the trigger wiring and DIO drive/slew setting. The <i>Dual Delay</i> option can be used to compensate the latency, in Scope under Time/Options, in Wavegen, Logic Analyzer and Pattern Generator under the top-right COG.<br>
When devices without reference clocking capability are used the signals may show jitter and shift over time.<br>
The dual mode has some limitations since one trigger line is used for cross-triggering so Scope and Logic Analyzer can't be used at the same time but Digital channels can be added to Scope interface. The Wavegen and Pattern Generator uses the same trigger line which is used to start the respective instrument. The dual mode for this is working with no trigger option and zero wait.<br>
- The additional device can also be a power supply device (DPS3340). In this case the the DPS can be controlled by <i>DiscoveryPS</i> tool in the main tab's instrument list.</p>

<h2><a name="main.calib" id="main.calib"></a>
4. Device Calibration</h2>
<p>Each device is calibrated during manufacturing test procedure. The calibration data is stored in the device non-volatile memory.</p>
<p>The Device Calibration window allows you to calibrate (fine-tune) a device's analog components, such as the read-voltage levels of the Oscilloscope or Voltmeters, the output level of the Waveform Generator, Adjustable Power Supplies of the Electronics Explorer board, or the Oscilloscope and Waveform Generator of the Analog Discovery device.<br>
The calibration frequency depends on the requirements. It can be done monthly, yearly, biannually or never, or before any critical project.</p>
<p>Start the Device Calibration window from the WaveForms main window Settings / Device Manager. <br>
The following window will open. The items in the calibration list depend on the selected device type.<br>
It is recommended to let the device to heat up for 5-10 minutes, to reach its operational temperature.<br>
Clicking on the links in the Calibration tab to perform calibration of subsystems.<br>
The Wizard can be a long process. It is better to perform the calibrations steps separately.</p>
<p>The Oscilloscope offset error can be compensated in the Scope instrument under Time and Channel options, Zero offset.

<h3><a name="main.calib.probe" id="main.calib.probe"></a>4.1 Probe Compensation</h3>
<p>The 10X oscilloscope probes need to be compensated with the used channel. The input impedance of devices and channel may differ which needs to be tuned to match the 10X probe.<br>To perform this, generate a 1-5kHz square signal and adjust the trimmer on the BNC end, until you see a correct square wave in the oscilloscope. The Network Analyzer can also be used for the adjustment.</p>

<h3><a name="main.plots" id="main.plots"></a>
5.3. Plots </h3>
<p>The center of the plot is marked with grid lines. Each vertical and horizontal line constitutes a major division. For linear scales, these are laid out in a 10x10 division pattern. The tick marks on the axis between major divisions are called minor divisions. For logarithmic scales, major ticks are shown for each decay value and minor ticks for 2,3,4... points.</p>
<p>The plots and axes allow the following scaling adjustments:
<ul>
<li>With mouse wheel (or two finger scroll on touchpad) over left or bottom axis, the channel range or time base is adjusted. For start/stop (frequency) and top/bottom (dB) values, the right/upper side of the axis adjust the start/bottom value and the left/lower side the stop/top value. 
<li>With mouse wheel on the plot zooms in or out around the cursor position. 
<li>With left-button mouse drag, on left or bottom axis, the offset or position is adjusted. For top/bottom values both levels are shifted. 
<li>With right-button mouse drag performs zooms in or out having in the the middle the press position.
<li>Having the Ctrl key pressed speeds up and Shift slows down the respective operation. The Alt key swaps the left-right or range-offset adjustment.
<li>The double-click on the axis sets the offset, position, start or top value to zero.
<li>After focusing by clicking on axis or plot, the keyboard arrow keys can also be used to change the offset and range, to move and scale the plot.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each plot has a button in the top-right corner which opens a drop-down menu (or mouse right-click) containing options for:
<ul>

<h2> <a name="main.states" id="main.states"></a>6. States</h2>
<p>The active instruments (Oscilloscope, Wavegen, Logic, and Patterns) step through states while acquiring or generating a signal.</p>
<p>From each of these instruments, multiple instances can be opened at a time, however, only one instance can be active. When more instruments of the same type are opened, the last used instance (after pressing Run or Stop) controls the device. The others display a <strong>Busy</strong> status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

6.1. Acquisition States</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Ready:</b> instrument is not running.</li>
<li><strong>Config</strong>: instrument is under configuration or acquisition buffer is prefilled.</li>
<li><b>Armed:</b> instrument is armed and is waiting for a trigger event to occur while writing to the buffer.</li>
<li><b>Trig'd:</b> acquisition is triggered writing to buffer the needed post-trigger samples. It is useful when repeated acquisitions are running to see whether the trigger condition was met or the acquisition was automatic.</li>
<li><b>Auto:</b> acquisition is automatically started and not by the trigger condition.</li>
<li><b>Done:</b> single acquisition is completed.</li>
<li><b>Stop:</b> instrument was stopped.</li>
<li><strong>Scan:</strong> instrument is running in scan screen or shift mode. </li>
<li><b>Error:</b> is displayed if you have just disconnected the device from the PC. <br>
</li>

6.2. Generator States</h3>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the states of the Arbitrary
Waveform Generator and Digital Pattern Generator.</p>
<p><img src="images/main.out.states.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>The instrument leaves the <strong>Ready</strong> state if it is started with the Run or Run All buttons or any changes have been made.</li>
<li>The instrument is in the <strong>Config</strong> state for a short while when the new configuration is applied. It then goes to the <strong>Armed</strong> state if it is started or changes have been made while running. Otherwise, it goes back to the <strong>Ready</strong> state. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Armed</strong> state, it waits for the trigger. The trigger can come from any other instrument or external source. If 'None' trigger source has been specified, signal generation starts immediately. </li>
<li>It pauses in the <b>Wait</b> state until the specified wait time elapses.</li>
<li>In the <b>Run</b> state, signal generation is enabled until the specified run-time elapses. If the continuous option has been specified, it stays in this state until stopped.</li>
<li>The (Trigger)&ndash;Wait&ndash;Run cycle is repeated the number of times specified by the <b>Repeat</b> parameter, then it goes to the <b>Done</b> state. If the infinite option has been specified, it always goes back to the <strong>Wait</strong> state until it is stopped.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Repeat cycle can be configured to include or exclude Trigger. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wait&ndash;Run</strong> mode: once triggered, will repeat the wait-run cycle for the specified times.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger&ndash;Wait&ndash;Run</strong> mode: waits for the trigger event each time before entering the Wait and Run states.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any setting (frequency, duty, signal type, etc.) is modified from any state, it goes right to the Config state. If the instrument was running, it will be started again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2> <a name="main.trigger" id="main.trigger"></a>7. Triggers </h2>
<p>The Electronics Explorer board has four trigger IO pins, the Analog Discovery has two. They are used by the Oscilloscope, Arbitrary Waveform Generators, Logic Analyzer, and Digital Pattern Generator instruments. The trigger event is by default the rising edge of the trigger signal, but it can be configured to be the falling or either edge.<br>
An instrument's trigger output is high while in Run state.<br>
By default the run time is continuous in Wavegen and Patterns, so these will toggle their trigger outputs when started or stopped.<br>
To have repetitive trigger event specify a finite run time in Patterns and Wavegen, after selecting an other option than "No synchronization".</p>
<p>Any of these instruments can be triggered by any of the trigger signals coming from external pins or the other instruments. </p>
<p>The Waveform Generator channels can function as independent instruments, having their own controller, or in synchronized mode when the selected channels are controlled by one state controller.</p>
<p>The input instruments (Oscilloscope and Logic) have a trigger detector based on their input channels.</p>
<p>The Manual Trigger event is generated by pressing the button under the main window device menu. On the Electronics Explorer board, this trigger event is generated when the board switch is turned to the on position as well.</p>
<p>The None trigger mode configuration in the instruments means that acquisition or generation doesn't wait for a trigger, it starts immediately. </p>
<p>The Auto trigger mode for input instruments means that if the trigger condition doesn't appear in maximum from two seconds and holdoff value plus the specified time span, acquisition is started automatically. </p>
<p>In multiple acquisition mode, when the instruments switch to Auto trigger, subsequent acquisitions are made without waiting for timeout as long as a trigger event does not occur and the configuration is not changed. When a new trigger event occurs or the configuration is changed, the current acquisition is finished and the next one waits for the trigger. It is also the best mode to use if you are looking at many signals and do not want to set the trigger each time. </p>
