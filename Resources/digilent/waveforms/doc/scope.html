<h1><a name="scope.scope" id="scope.scope"></a>Oscilloscope</h1> 
<p>An oscilloscope (or &ldquo;scope&rdquo;) allows you to view a signal's waveform, typically in a two-dimensional graph where one or more electrical signals (on the vertical axis) are plotted as a function of time or of some other voltage (on the horizontal axis). </p>
<p>Most of the time, oscilloscopes are used to show events that repeat with either no change or events that change slowly.</p>

<p>The Control toolbar allows you to stabilize repeating waveforms and capture single-shot waveforms. By default, this only shows the most important options. The down/up arrow in the top right corner shows/hides the other features.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Single </b>button: starts a single acquisition.</li><br>
<li><b>Run/Stop </b>button: starts a repeated, continuous acquisition, or recording (see <a href="#scope.mode">Mode</a>). While the acquisition is in progress, the Run button becomes the Stop button.</li><br>

<li><img src="images/cog.png">
<ul> 
<li><b>Buffers</b>: adjusts the number of PC and device buffers for repeated captures.</li>
<li><b>Run:</b> selects the Run operation for repeated captures to be Continuous, Stop when the specified Buffers or Limit number of captures are collected.</li>
<li><b>Device buffering</b> available with ADP3X50, EclypseZ7. When checked, in Repeated mode the device will store multiple captures at low latency. The number of device buffers is shown in the top of the main time view, <i>DevBuf: used/total</i>. The maximum device buffers is Scope capture memory/ specified Time-Samples/ Enabled device channels.<br>
In this mode the latency between captures with ADP3X50 is less than 1us, between 0.2 and 0.54 us</li>
<li><b>Clear buffers</b> deletes captured the PC buffers.</li>
<li><b>Delete all Tabs</b> closes all tabs.</li>
</ul></li><br>

<li><a name="scope.buffer" id="scope.buffer"></a><b>Buffer:</b> The performed acquisitions are stored in the PC buffer in time order. This makes it easy to review a series of repeated acquisitions. The new acquisitions are stored after the currently selected buffer position. If you change the position in the buffer and start a new acquisition, the positions after the selected one will be lost.</li>
<li><b>Add Tab:</b> Saves the currently shown acquisition data to a new tab. To close a tab, click the close button at the corner of the tab header. The name of the tab can be edited by double-clicking on the tab header.</li>
<br>

<li><a name="scope.mode" id="scope.mode"></a><b>Mode:</b> The mode options select the action of the Run button and are the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Repeated:</b> the Run button starts repeated acquisitions.</li>
<li>Scan <b>Screen:</b> scan acquisition where the sampled data is drawn from left to right. When the right corner is reached, the signal curve plot continues from the left.</li>
<li>Scan <b>Shift:</b> similar to the screen mode, but when the signal plot reaches the right corner, the curve plot slides to the left.</li>
<li><b>Record:</b> allows capturing large number of samples at lower rates. In this mode, the samples are streamed through the USB, limiting the rate (depending on the system and other connected devices) at about 1M samples/sec.<br>
Selecting the scan modes (Screen and Shift) will change the time base to be at least 1 second span, 100 ms/division. Adjusting the time base to lower than this value will change to Repeated mode.</li>
</ul></li><br>

<li><a name="scope.mode" id="scope.mode"></a><b>Trigger</b>: The three trigger modes are:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Normal:</b> the acquisition is triggered only on the specified condition. The oscilloscope only sweeps if the input signal reaches the set trigger point.</li>
<li><b>Auto:</b> when the trigger condition does not appear in maximum of 2 seconds and capture time, the acquisition is started automatically. In repeated acquisition mode, when the instrument switches to auto trigger, the next acquisitions are made without waiting again to timeout while a trigger event does not occur and the configuration is not changed. When a new trigger event occurs, or the configuration is changed, the current acquisition will be finished and the next one will wait for the trigger again. It is also the best mode to use if you are looking at many signals and do not want to bother setting the trigger each time.</li>
<li><b>None:</b> the acquisition is started without a trigger.</li>
</ul></p></li>

<li><a name="scope.trigger.source" id="scope.trigger.source"></a><b>Source:</b> The trigger source selects the oscilloscope channel that is used for the trigger. Other instruments or external trigger signals can be used to trigger the oscilloscope.</li><br>

<li><a name="scope.trigger.type" id="scope.trigger.type"></a><b>Type:</b> The trigger type selects between <a href="#scope.trigger.edge">edge</a>, <a href="#scope.trigger.pulse">pulse</a>, <a href="#scope.trigger.transition">transition</a>, and <a href="#scope.trigger.window">window</a>.</li><br>

<ul>
<li><a name="scope.trigger.edge" id="scope.trigger.edge"></a><b>Edge:</b> Edge triggering is the basic and most common type. For edge triggering, the trigger level and slope controls provide the basic trigger point definition. The trigger circuit acts as a comparator. You select the slope and voltage level of one side of the comparator. When the trigger signal matches your settings, the oscilloscope generates a trigger.<br>

<p>The slope-condition control determines whether the trigger point is on the rising, on the falling, or either edges of a signal.  A rising edge is a positive slope and a falling edge is a negative slope. The level control determines where the trigger point occurs on the edge. The following figure shows you how the trigger slope and level settings determine the waveform display.</p>

</table></div><br>
<li>
<a name="scope.trigger.pulse" id="scope.trigger.pulse"></a><b>Pulse:</b> If the trigger type is set to Pulse, then the oscilloscope will trigger if a positive/negative pulse has a larger/smaller length than the one already set by the user. For example, if the pulse is smaller than the length set, and the triggering condition is set to more, the oscilloscope will not trigger.

<p>
The picture below shows a positive pulse trigger configured for less than 200 &micro;s.
</p>

<br>
<li><a name="scope.trigger.transition" id="scope.trigger.transition"></a><b>Transition:</b> The transition trigger is similar to the pulse trigger, but here the transition time of a signal is compared with the specified length. The low and high transition levels are specified by the hysteresis window.

<li><a name="scope.trigger.window" id="scope.trigger.window"></a><b>Window:</b> It triggers on entering or exiting the low or high levels specified by the level and plus-minus the hysteresis. The Length option can be used for glitch filtering.
<p>The picture below shows an exiting window trigger at &plusmn;0.5V </p>
<p><img src="images/scope.plot.window.png"></p>
</li>

</ul><br>


<li><a name="scope.trigger.condition" id="scope.trigger.condition"></a><b>Condition:</b> The trigger condition for <a href="#scope.trigger.edge">Edge</a> type and internal or external sources selects between rising, falling, or either edge. For <a href="#scope.trigger.transition">Transition</a> type selects between rising or falling. For <a href="#scope.trigger.pulse">Pulse</a> trigger, it selects between positive or negative pulse.</li><br> 
For internal triggers (Wavegen, Patterns...), the rising edge is the start and falling end of the generation.<br>

<li><a name="scope.trigger.level" id="scope.trigger.level"></a><b>Level:</b> The trigger level is the adjustable voltage level at which the scope triggers when the trigger input crosses this value. See <a href="#scope.trigger.hysteresis">Hysteresis</a> and <a href="#scope.trigger.type">Type</a>.</li><br>
<li>
<a name="scope.trigger.hysteresis" id="scope.trigger.hysteresis"></a><b>Hyst.:</b> Using hysteresis, low and high levels are determined (the trigger level plus and minus the hysteresis value). When the signal level exceeds the high level, it is considered as high and will stay high until falling below the low level. This is used to avoid bouncing caused by signal noise and also to specify the transition trigger conditions. The Auto option uses 1% of the specified trigger channel range value.</li>
</p>
<p><img src="images/scope.plot.hysteresis.png"></p>
<p>The picture below shows how, without hysteresis, the trigger event also occurs on the falling edge of the input signal due to signal noise.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/scope.plot.hysteresis2.png" ></p>
<br>

<li><a name="scope.trigger.lcondition" id="scope.trigger.lcondition"></a><b>Length Condition:</b> The trigger length condition selects between less, time out, or more for pulse length or transition time. See <a href="#scope.trigger.pulse">Pulse</a> and <a href="#scope.trigger.transition">Transition</a> trigger.</li><br>

<li><a name="scope.trigger.length" id="scope.trigger.length"></a><b>Trigger Length:</b> The trigger length specifies the minimal or maximal pulse length or transition time. See <a href="#scope.trigger.pulse">Pulse</a> and <a href="#scope.trigger.transition">Transition</a> trigger.</li><br>

<li><a name="scope.trigger.holdoff" id="scope.trigger.holdoff"></a><b>Holdoff:</b> The trigger holdoff is an adjustable period of time during which the oscilloscope will not trigger. This feature is useful when you are triggering on complex waveform shapes, so the oscilloscope triggers only on the first eligible trigger point.</li>
<p>The following figure shows how the trigger holdoff helps to create a usable display.</p>
<p><img src="images/scope.plot.holdoff.png"><br><i>Trigger with 10ms holdoff</i></p>
<p><img src="images/scope.plot.noholdoff.png"><br>
<i>Trigger without holdoff</i></p>
<p>The holdoff length should be around the maximum burst length, preferably a little bit more, but not less than this. For the above situation, the holdoff value should be around 6ms, but lengths between 6 and 15 ms are also acceptable.
</p><br>

<li><a name="scope.trigger.filter" id="scope.trigger.filter"></a><b>Filter:</b> The trigger sample selects the sample mode that will be used by the trigger detector. This can be different from the one used for acquisition, which is why the trigger event might not be visible on the acquired data. The Auto option uses a filter based on the selected trigger source channel Sample Mode.</li>
<br>

<li><b>Auto Set</b> button: performs automatic adjustment of the enabled real and math channels, and trigger configuration according to the input signals. The offset and range of the real channels is determined by the minimum and maximum input levels of one second time span. The trigger is set to rising edge of the channel with the lowest frequency and higher amplitude input signal.</li><br>



</ul>
<p>The <b>Record to File</b> can be opened under Control menu or <i>Rec.</i> toolbar button. This lets you capture samples directly to file in Binary, NI TDMS, WAV or text file.</p>

<p>Use the time group to position and scale the waveform horizontally using the time base and the horizontal trigger position controls.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="scope.time.position" id="scope.time.position"></a><b>Position:</b> The horizontal position control moves the waveform left or right to exactly where you want it on the screen. It actually represents the horizontal position of the trigger in the waveform recording. Varying the horizontal trigger position allows you to capture what a signal did before a trigger event (so-called 
&ldquo;pre-trigger viewing&rdquo;).</li><br>
Digital oscilloscopes can provide pre-trigger viewing because they constantly process the input signal, whether a trigger has been received or not. Pre-trigger viewing is a valuable troubleshooting aid. For example, if a problem occurs intermittently you can trigger on the problem, record the events that led up to it, and possibly find the cause.<br><br></li>

<li><a name="scope.time.base" id="scope.time.base"></a><b>Base:</b> The time base setting (seconds/division) from the channel configuration toolbar lets you select the rate at which the waveform is drawn across the screen. This setting is a scale factor. For example, if the setting is 1 ms, each horizontal division represents 1 ms and the total screen width represents 10 ms (ten divisions). Changing the sec/div setting allows you to visualize longer or shorter time intervals of the input signal.</li><br>
<li><b>Average:</b> specifies the number of acquisitions to average. </li>
<li><b>Overs.:</b> specifies the oversampling ratio. <br>
Average and Oversampling require repetitive signal and stable trigger with Single or Repeated acquisition. The individual captures are aligned and combined based on peak frequency phase of trigger source channel or Channel 1 when other trigger source is used, or trigger crossing of source channel when no peak or too low frequency is detected. For peak frequency alignment <i>Acquisition # X/X @ MHz</i> is displayed and for trigger crossing alignment <i>Acquisition # X/X</i>.<br>
The oversampling requires external waveform source since the ones produced by the device Wavegen or Patterns are synchronous with the Scope.<br>
The ADP3450 and ADP3250 can shift the Scope captures at 4 phases, so it can oversample at least by 4 the signals generated by the same device, resulting in a 0.5 GS/s sample rate with 125 MS/s device frequency adjustable under Settings/ Options/ Device.<br>
The Average value 1 interpolates the samples with respect to trigger point.<br>
The Oversample value 1 enables Scope capture shifting for ADP3X50.</li><br>
<li><b>Samples:</b> adjust the number of samples to acquire.</li><br>
<li><b>Rate:</b> adjusts the sample rate. It can be natural divisions of the 100MHz system/ADC frequency, like 50MHz, 33MHz, 25MHz...1Hz, 1mHz</li><br>
</ul>

<p>In the property drop-down, the following can be configured: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Position as division:</b> selects the unit of the position parameter, division, or seconds.</li>
<li><b>Range Mode:</b> selects the display mode for time base (per division, plus-minus, and full).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Options drop-down, the following can be configured: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Channel Editor:</b> opens a configuration window for the real channels</li>

<p>Use the real channel (vertical controls) to position and scale the waveforms vertically using the offset and range controls for each channel.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="scope.offset" id="scope.offset"></a><b>Offset:</b> The offset (vertical position) control lets you move the waveform up or down to exactly where you want it on the screen. The offset is the voltage difference between the center line of the oscilloscope screen and the actual ground. This difference is generated by an internal offset voltage source.</p></li>
<li><a name="scope.range" id="scope.range"></a><b>Range:</b> The range (volts/division) controls determine the vertical scale of the graph drawn on the oscilloscope screen. The volts/div setting is a scale factor. For example, if the volts/div setting is 2 volts, then each of the ten vertical divisions represents 2 volts and the entire screen can show 20 volts from bottom to top. If the setting is 0.5 volts/div, the screen can display 5 volts from bottom to top, and so on. The maximum voltage you can display on the screen is the volts/div setting multiplied by the number of vertical divisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the property drop-down, the following can be configured:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Color:</b> sets the channel waveform color.</li>
<li><b>Offset as division:</b> selects the unit of the offset parameter, division, or voltage.</li>
<li><b>Noise:</b> shows or hides the noise band (min/max values).</li>
<li><b>Range mode:</b> selects the display mode for the range of the channels (per division, plus-minus, and full).</li>
<li><a name="scope.attenuation" id="scope.attenuation"></a><b>Attenuation:</b> specifies the used probe attenuation. The probe at 10X needs to be <a href="main.html#main.calib.probe">tuned</a>! It can be used specify external amplification like for 50* amplification use 0.02X Use negative value to invert the signal.</li>
<li><b>Units</b>: lets you specify the channel units.</li>
<li><b>Coupling</b>: lets you select the input coupling between AC and DC. Available with ADP3X50 and ADP5XX0. This option does not change the input coupling of EExplorer and Analog Discovery BNC adapter boards. These have separate input and jumper for such coupling options.</li>
<li><a name="scope.bandwidth" id="scope.bandwidth"></a><b>Bandwidth</b>: lets you select the bandwidth filter. Available with ADP3X50 and ADP5XX0.</li>
<li><a name="scope.impedance" id="scope.impedance"></a><b>Impedance</b>: lets you select the input impedance. Available with ADP5XX0.</li>
<li><a name="scope.samplemode" id="scope.samplemode"></a><b>Sample Mode:</b> sets the acquisition sample mode. The oscilloscope AD converter works at a fixed frequency. Depending on the time base setting and the size of the oscilloscope buffer, the sampling frequency can be less than the AD conversion frequency. For instance, if the AD conversion frequency is 100 MHz (10 ns), the buffer size is 8000 samples and the time base is 200 &micro;s/division, then between two samples there will be 25 AD conversions. The following filters can be applied to the extra conversions:</li>
<ul>
  <li><b>Decimate:</b> will record only the Nth AD conversion.</li>
  <li><b>Average:</b> each sample will be calculated as the average of the AD conversions.</li>
  <li><b>Min/Max:</b> each two samples will be calculated as the minimum and maximum value of the conversion results.</li>
  <li><b>Full Scale:</b> similar to average but the stored samples match the specified range instead of the device input range options. This can improve the vertical resolution of the samples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Zero:</b> lets you fine adjust the zero level, for quick offset calibration.</li>
<li><b>Shift:</b> lets you shift the channel horizontal position.</li>
<li><b>Export:</b> Opens export window with the respective channel data. See <a href="main.html#main.export">Export</a> in Common Interfaces.</li>
<li><b>Name:</b> specifies the channel name.</li>

<h4><a name="scope.coupling" id="scope.coupling"></a>Input Coupling</h4>
<p>Coupling is the method used to connect an electrical signal from one circuit to another. In this case, the input coupling is the connection from your test circuit to the oscilloscope.</p>
<p>On the Electronics Explorer board, the input coupling AC and DC are separate input connectors on the board with AC 
and DC marks. On the Analog Discovery BNC Adapter jumper, select 
between AC and DC coupling. DC coupling shows all of an input signal. AC coupling blocks the DC component of a signal so that you see the waveform centered at zero volts.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates this difference. The AC coupling setting is handy when the entire signal (alternating plus continuous components) is too large for the volts/div setting.

3.3. Filter Channels</h3>

<p>The Filter channels can be configured in the oscilloscope interface, after collapsing these in the channels column.<br>
The ADP3X50, EclypseZ7, Analog Discovery 3 and newer devices support in-device filter channels. See the device description for more detail.<br>
The sampling on various channels can be enabled by checking the respective channel.<br>
<img src="images/scope.buffer.png"></p>

<p>For each real channel there is a Filter channels. The input of these can be selected to be the raw ADC data. In this case the filter is running at the specified system frequency. For the Decimate and Average options the filter rate will be the Scope rate, a downscaled system frequency common for all the Scope channels.<br>

<p>The Wavegen channels can be controlled from the oscilloscope interface, after collapsing these in the channels column.</p>
<p>The channel sampling can be enable only on the devices which support it.<br>
The ADP3X50, EclypseZ7, Analog Discovery 3 and newer devices support digital loopback of the Wavegen channels. See the device description for more detail.<br>
The captured output samples are the digital samples which are sent to the DAC. This is not an analog loopback to monitor the actual output! For such purpose use an Oscilloscope input channel.<br>
With ADP3X50 and EclypseZ7 the two Wavegen channel outputs, Amplitude and Frequency can be captured.<br>
With Analog Discovery 3 the two Wavegen channel outputs and the output or readback of the two Power Supply channels can be captured. This can be selected under the channel's option Sample Mode.</p>
<p>For every device the Wavegen channels can be controlled from property dropdown similar to Wavegen <a href="wavegen.html#wavegen.simple">Simple</a> configuration mode. The channels are started in synchronized mode.<br>When a Wavegen channel is controlled from Scope it takes control over this device resource and the respective channel will show busy in the Wavegen instrument.</p>

<h3><a name="scope.view.histogram" id="scope.view.histogram"></a>
5.8. Histogram</h3>
<p>A histogram is a graphical representation of the voltage distribution in a signal waveform. It plots the distribution of values for each voltage value, with the number of times the signal has a certain voltage value represented as a percentage.</p>
<p>The picture below shows the histogram view of a sine and another signal.</p>
<p>The Auto scale option adjusts the scale for each channel separately based on the maximum value. With manual scale, a common Top level can be specified.</p>
<p><img src="images/scope.view.histogram.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="scope.view.persistence" id="scope.view.persistence"></a>
5.9. Persistence</h3>
<p>Persistence view superimposes multiple waveform acquisitions on the same view. The more frequent waveforms are drawn with hotter colors than rare ones. The view is cleared by the clear button,  after making any configuration change, or restarting repeated acquisition.</p>
<p>This view is useful to detect glitches, or to catch a rare event in a series of repeated normal events. The areas of the view that have the highest density are red (hot), while the areas with the lowest density are blue (cold). The persistence is infinite.</p>
<p><img src="images/scope.view.persistence.png"></p>
<p><b>Top:</b> setting adjusts how plotted data points are colored. If a data point occurs infrequently enough to fall within the color range band (below the top setting), then it is colored according to how often it has been recorded as occurring. If the data point falls outside the band, meaning it occurs frequently and consistently, then it is colored with whatever the identifying color of its scope input channel is (orange for ch1, blue for ch2, etc).<br>
<b>Middle:</b> setting adjusts the distribution of the range of colors used in the plot, so that a user might more easily distinguish the parts of the signal they are interested in. For example, raising the Middle setting narrows the range of occurrences that are colored red, so that a user might better be able to narrow in on and differentiate between frequently-occurring points in the signal.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="scope.view.eye" id="scope.view.eye"></a>
5.10. Eye Pattern</h3>
<p>Eye Pattern view superimposes multiple samples of signal periods from one or multiple captures. The more frequent waveforms are drawn with hotter colors than rare ones.</p>
<p>It is recommended to be used with high number of Samples which is adjustable in the Time group or select Record mode if the device supports it, like ADP3X50 with DDRam recording. When used with repetitive captures the phase information information between the capture is unknown and information about low frequency jitter is lost.</p>
<p>If the device supports frequency adjustment (like ADP3X50) it is good to set this to an unrelated to the analyzed rate. This to improve the frequency and phase detection method by having varying phase between the signal and sampling. If supported, the device frequency can be adjusted under Settings/ Options/ Device.</p>
<p><img src="images/scope.view.eye1.png"><br><img src="images/scope.view.eye2.png"></p>

<li><b>Average Threshold:</b> check to average auto threshold(s) when running; otherwise threshold(s) are measured individually for each capture.</li>
<li><b>Average Rate:</b> check to average auto rate when running; otherwise rate is measured individually for each capture.</li><br>
<li><b>Top:</b> setting adjusts how plotted data points are colored. If a data point occurs infrequently enough to fall within the color range band (below the top setting), then it is colored according to how often it has been recorded as occurring. If the data point falls outside the band, meaning it occurs frequently and consistently, then it is colored with whatever the identifying color of its scope input channel is (orange for ch1, blue for ch2, etc).</li>
<li><b>Middle:</b> setting adjusts the distribution of the range of colors used in the plot, so that a user might more easily distinguish the parts of the signal they are interested in. For example, raising the Middle setting narrows the range of occurrences that are colored red, so that a user might better be able to narrow in on and differentiate between frequently-occurring points in the signal.</li>

Vertical-axis measurements for each channel:
<ul>
<li><b>Maximum:</b> the absolute largest value.</li>
<li><b>Minimum:</b> the absolute smallest value.</li>
<li><b>Average:</b> the mean value between maximum and minimum values.</li>
<li><b>Peak2Peak:</b> the difference between the extreme maximum and minimum values.</li>

<li><b>DC RMS:</b> direct current root mean square represents the RMS applied to the entire signal, including AC and DC components.</li>
<li><b>AC RMS:</b> alternating current root mean square is used to characterize AC signals by subtracting out the DC, leaving only the AC signal components.</li>
<li><b>Overshoot:</b> = (Peak to Peak / 2 - Amplitude) / Amplitude.</li>
<li><b>Rise Overshoot:</b> = (Maximum - High) / Amplitude.</li>
<li><b>Fall Overshoot:</b> = (Minimum - Low) / Amplitude.</li>

<p>The Add/<b>Custom Channel measurement</b> opens a script editor with an average calculation example script. A custom measurement involving one Channel's data can be created here. This will be added to the Defined Measurement Custom category list to be used for other channels.<br>
<b>T1</b> and <b>T2</b> are time positions relative to T0. The value of these: for <b>Capture</b> extent represent the first and last sample of the capture, for <b>Visible</b> the currently visible time span, and for <b>Cursor</b> the selected X cursors positions. The Channel.getData(T1,T2) returns the samples for the time span, Channel.measure("name", T1, T2) the measurement performed between T1 and T2.<br>
See the predefined vertical measurements that can be opened with Edit as read-only examples.</p>
<p>See <a href="main.html#main.script">Script</a> in Common interfaces. In the Locals menu, you can find Time and Channel, which are two script specific objects.</p>
<p>Average calculation:</p>
<p><code>// initialize a local variable<br>
  var value = 0<br>
  var data = Channel.getData(T1,T2)
  // loop to access each sample<br>
  data.forEach(function(sample){<br>
  // make sum of samples<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value+=sample<br>
  })<br>
  // divide the sum with the number of samples to get the average<br>
  value /= data.length<br>
  // last line of code is the measurement value<br>
  </code>
</p>
<p>Accessing other measurements, calculating peak-to-peak value:</p>
<p><code>Channel.measure("Maximum",T1,T2) - Channel.measure("Minimum",T1,T2)<br>
  </code>
</p>
<br>
<p>The Add/<b>Custom Global measurement</b> opens a script editor with a phase calculation example script. Custom measurement accessing multiple channels can be created here. The Local is the instrument object called Scope.</p>
<p>Phase calculation:</p>
<p><code>// initialize local variables<br>
  var sum1 = 0<br>
  var sum2 = 0<br>
  var sum12 = 0<br>
  // for better performance get and use local copy of data array<br>
  var d1 = Scope.Channel1.getData(T1,T2)<br>
  var d2 = Scope.Channel2.getData(T1,T2)<br>
  var c = d1.length<br>
  for(var i = 0; i < c; i++){<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum1 += d1[i]*d1[i]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum2 += d2[i]*d2[i]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum12 += d1[i]*d2[i]<br>
  }<br>
  sum1 /= c<br>
  sum2 /= c<br>
  sum12 /= c<br>
  // last line of code is the measurement value<br>
  acos(sum12/sqrt(sum1*sum2))*180/PI<br>
  </code>
</p>
<p>Accessing other measurements, calculating gain in dB:</p>
<p><code>log10(Scope.Channel1.measure("Amplitude",T1,T2)/Scope.Channel2.measure("Amplitude",T1,T2))<br>
  </code>
</p>

5.14. Audio</h3>
<p>The audio view can play the data as sound using the default audio output of the computer.</p>
<p><img src="images/scope.view.audio.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Start/Stop:</b> starts or stops the audio playback.</li>
<li><b>Mode:</b> select Mono or Stereo playback mode.</li>
<li><b>Left</b>:/<b>Right</b>: can be one of the real or math channels.</li>
<li><b>Speed:</b> is the ration between playback and capture rates. Speed = audio Rate / ( capture rate / Tempo )</li>
<li><b>Rate:</b> is the sample rate at which the channel data is played back on the computers audio output.</li>
<li><b>Tempo:</b> lets you skip capture samples. This is useful in case you capture (record) at high frequency, since the computer audio usually tops at 192kHz. For instance, if you capture at 1MHz with Tempo 10x will playback only every 10th samples, so with 100kHz you can play back at normal (1X) Speed.</li>
<li><b>Volume:</b> is expressed as a percentage.</li>
<li><b>Output:</b> selects the audio output device.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to continuously play back the capture data use Speed 1X and scan Screen or Shift acquisition Modes.</p>
