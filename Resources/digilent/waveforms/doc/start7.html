2. Software</h2>
<p>The WaveForms support for Eclypse Z7 and Zmods is closed source, including the application, API library, firmware and FPGA configurations. It can be used with WaveForms application and SDK/API from a computer.<br>
For open source application see the <a target="_blank" href="https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/eclypse-z7/start">Resource Center</a>.</p>
<h3>2.1 Setup</h3>
<p>In order to use the Eclypse Z7 and Zmods with WaveForms the following firmware needs to be booted from the SD card or QSPI flash. These are deployed by the WaveForms installer and can be found in the following paths:
<ul><li>Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Digilent\WaveForms3\Config\</li>
<li>MacOS: /Applications/WaveForms.app/Contents/Frameworks/dwf.framework/Resources/digilent/waveforms/firmware/</li>
<li>Linux: /usr/share/digilent/waveforms/firmware/</li></ul></p>

<h4>A. Copy to microSD</h4>
<ul>
<li>Copy the <b>DCFG_07_01_01.bin</b> file  (the <b>BIN</b> and not the BIT file!) to the micro SD card root folder as <b>boot.bin</b><br>
Note that Zynq supports booting from <b>SD/SDHC FAT</b> 16/32 up to 32GB. For higher density card <b>SDXC</b> create a smaller FAT primary partition.</li>
<li>Insert the SD card in the Eclypse Z7.</li>
<li>Set JP5 jumper to SD.</li>
<li>Make sure JP1 and JP2 are removed between the USB-USB and barrel jack.</li>
<li>Connect the computer to the USB port labeled <b>USB</b> since this will be used for control and data transfer.</li>
<li>Turn ON the board power.</li>
</ul>
<h4>B. Program the QSPI</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Connect computer to the USB port labeled <b>PROG</b></li>
<li>Set JP5 jumper to JTAG.
<li>Connect 12V DC supply.</li>
<li>Turn ON the board power.</li>
<li>Under Windows copy the <b>DCFG_07_01_01.bin</b> and <b>DCFG_07_01_01.elf</b> files to a directory like to C:\temp since Vivado can't access path like Program Files (x86)</li>
<li>Launch Vivado/ Open Hardware Manager/ Open target / Auto Connect</li>
<li>Right click on xc7020/ "Add configuration memory device"</li>
<li>Select Spansion, 128, qspi, x4-single, s25fl128-3.3v-qspi-x4-single, OK, see picture below</li>
<li>OK or right click the s25fl... "Program configuration memory device"</li>
<li>Select configuration file <b>DCFG_07_01_01.bin</b> (the <b>BIN</b> and not the BIT file!), see picture below</li>
<li>Select FSBL use DCFG_07_01_01.elf</li>
<li>OK and wait programming to finish.</li>
<li>Turn OFF the board power.</li>
<li>Set JP5 jumper to QSPI.</li>
<li>Make sure JP1 and JP2 are removed between the USB-USB and barrel jack.</li>
<li>Connect the computer to the USB port labeled <b>USB</b> since this will be used for control and data transfer.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><img src="images/start7.qspi1.png"><img src="images/start7.qspi2.png"></p>
<p>The <b>DCFG_07_01_01.bin</b> file is just a firmware/PS image providing USB and Ethernet WaveForms connection. The PL will be programmed only on software connection to the device, so the green FPGA/PL DONE LED on the Eclypse Z7 will light up only on WaveForms application connection or custom WF SDK/API open function call.</p>
<br>

<h4>2.2 Use cases</h4>
<p>The unit can be used as instrumentation device over USB and Ethernet with WaveForms application or custom application based on WF SDK.</p>

<p><img src="images/start7.usage.png"></p>

<p>Most of the device embedded DDR RAM is used as Scope and Logic Analyzer buffer. </p>
<p><img src="images/start7.rec.png"><br><img src="images/start7.rec2.png"></p>

<p>The device will reboot in the following cases:<br>
- when the USB device cable is disconnected or on USB detach, like when the computer goes to sleep<br>
- when the Ethernet cable is disconnected or link goes down for at least 5 seconds and there is not active USB software connection</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="start7.network" id="start7.network"></a>
2.3 Network Settings</h4>
<p>The Network Settings lets you configure the Ethernet port. By default the Ethernet is disabled but it can be enabled with USB connection.</p>
<p>The <i>Enable Ethernet interface</i> is recommended to be unchecked if it is not used to speed up the device boot time. Having this enabled but no link it will block the firmware for a few seconds at startup.</p>
<p>The computer from which the device is used should be connected to the same network. On Windows make sure the network profile is Private.</p>
<p>When <i>Obtain IP address automatically</i> is checked the device will try to obtain IP address from DHCP server, it this fails the specified IP settings are used.</p>
<p>The <i>Use the following static IP address</i> should be checked when fixed IP is required or the device is connected directly to the computer in order to skip auto-configuration to speed up the connection time.<br>
In this case the same subnet but different IP should be configured on the computer port too, like 192.168.2.10/255.255.255.0 and 192.168.2.11/255.255.255.0<br>Also make sure the subnet address (192.168.2) is not in conflict with subnets of the other ports of the computer.</p>
<p>The values on the left are the stored values and on the right, the read-only fields, show the current values.</p>
<p><img src="images/start7.network.png"></p><br>

<a name="start7.remote" id="start7.remote"></a>
<p>The <b>Remote Devices</b> is intended to manage devices that are not discoverable like on a remote VPN. These entries are stored in current users folder unecrypted. For security concern the user name and password can be left empty and these will be asked when connecting to the device.</p>
<p><img src="images/start6.remote.png"></p><br>

<a name="start7.users" id="start7.users"></a>
<p>The <b>Device Users</b> lets you manage the accounts on a device. Up to 20 users can be added for a device. When the authentication is enabled connection to the device over network is only allowed with stored account. Login with <i>Admin</i> users can manage the users list. Without <i>Admin</i> right the user is only allowed to use the device and change its password.<br>
When Authentication is enabled only admin users are allowed to edit Users list, Rename the device, Network and Boot settings.<br>
The USB connection to a device is implicit admin, no authentication is required.</p>
<p><img src="images/start6.users.png"><img src="images/start6.users2.png"></p><br>

<a name="start7.pwd" id="start7.pwd"></a>
<p>When connecting to a network device with enabled authentication the entered user and password can be remembered locally.<br>
The <b>Local Passwords</b> lets you manage the stored device credentials. These are stored in local user directory with encrypted passwords.</p>
<p><img src="images/start6.user.png"><img src="images/start6.pwd.png"></p><br>

<h2>3. Calibration</h2>
<p>Each Zmod is calibrated at the factory during the manufacturing test procedure. The calibration data is stored in the Zmod's non-volatile memory.<br>
The Calibrate tab lists the available calibration modules and can be used to launch them. The Parameters tab shows calibration data of the main modules. The References tab lets you review the last performed calibration steps.</p>
<p><img src="images/start7.calib.png"></p>

<h2><a name="start7.instruments" id="start7.instruments"></a>
4. Scope and Wavegen</h2>

<p>The number of Oscilloscope and Wavegen channels and capabilities depend on the loaded Zmods.</p>
<p>There are 4 configurations (FPGA/PL images) provided to support combinations of Zmod Scope/Digitizer (ADC) or AWG (DAC) loaded in ZMOD A and B. The suitable configuration is automatically selected based on the loaded Zmods.<br>
Note that the software does not support combining Scope and Digitizer Zmods.</p>
<p><img src="images/start7.dev.png"></p>

<p>The Zmods will run at the same frequency which is by default the lowest from the Zmods but it is adjustable under Settings/ Options/ Device menu.<br>
The Reference clock option is for the Zmod Digitizer's CDCE input. When only one of the Zmods is Digitizer and the Reference clock option is Internal the oscillator on this will be used to drive the ADC through the CDCE IC. The system and the other Zmod will be driven by the clock received from the Digitizer Zmod's ADC. In other chases the Zmods ADC/DAC are driven by the clock synthesized in the Eclypse Z7 Zynq directly for Zmod Scope and AWG, and through the CDCE IC on the Zmod Digitizer.</p>

5. Digital I/O</h2>
<p>The Eclypse Pmod ports A0-7 and B0-7 can be used as 16 digital I/Os (DIO 0-15).<br>
These are LVCMOS3V3 with 8mA drive and slow slew rate.</p>
<p>The DIO 14 and 15 can be also used as trigger IO. When such output is enabled it will override the control from Static IO or Pattern Generator.
