<h1>Getting started with the Electronics Explorer Board</h1>

<h2>1. Hardware</h2>
<p>
To set up the board:</p>
<ol>
<li>First install the Digilent WaveForms software on your PC. See <a href="main.html#main.installer">Installer Details</a> for more information. </li>
<li>Connect a 12V 60W power supply to the Electronics Explorer board.</li>
<li>Connect the board to your PC using a USB cable. </li>
<li>The Ready LED will light when the Output Enable switch is ON and the WaveForms application is connected to the board.
</ol>
<p>All of the components of the board work relative to the common ground. None of the instruments have a floating ground.</p>

<h2>2. WaveForms Software</h2>
<p>
See <a href="main.html#main.installer">Installer Details</a> for information on installing WaveForms.</p>
<p>
See <a href="main.html">WaveForms</a> for information on using the 
software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="start1.trouble" id="start1.trouble"></a>3. Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>In case you receive the &ldquo;Communication with device failed&rdquo; error message:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all of the attached components and wires from the device.</li>
<li>Verify that the USB cable is attached correctly, reconnect it.</li>
<li>Verify that the power supply is 12V at least 60W.</li>
<li>Connect with WaveForms to the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>The board switch in the OFF position disables all of the outputs. In this case, an &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; text is shown in the main window status bar and in the main plot of instruments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>The DC inputs have an impedance of 9.3 MOhms in parallel with 10 pF.
<li>The AC inputs have 100 nF filter capacitor.
<li>The input voltage is from -20 V to 20 V.
<li>The ADC is 40 MHz, 10 bits, with adjustable resolution from 800 uV to 40 mV.
<li>The offset is adjustable from -20 V to 20 V.
<li>The maximum input voltage is 200 V.
<li>The buffer can be up to 16 KiS (default is 8KiS) on four channels.
</ul><br>

<h2>5. Arbitrary Waveform Generator</h2>
<p>
The Electronics Explorer board is equipped with two Waveform Generators.        
</p>
<p><b>Specifications:</b></p> 
<ul>
<li>The output current is 25 mA.
<li>The DAC is 14 bits and 40 MSps.
<li>The output 20Vp-p, 1.2 mV resolution.
<li>The output bandwidth is 20 MHz.
<li>When a channel is closed, the output is not in high impedance but should be close to zero volts. Verify the voltage on the Waveform Generator channels before connecting it to a circuit.
<li>The carrier buffer can be up to 32 KiS (default is 8KiS) or 16KiS carrier and 16KiS modulation buffer on two channels.
<li>The positive and negative power supplies can be used as slow voltage or current basic waveform generators.
</ul><br>

<h2>6. Power Supplies and Voltmeters</h2>
<p>
The board has four voltmeters, two reference voltages, one positive, one negative, and one 3.3/5V supply.
</p>
<p><b>Specifications:</b></p> 
<ul>
<li>The fixed power supply 3.3/5 V can provide up to 2 A.
<li>The positive power supply has a range of 0 to 9 V and 0 to 1.5 A current limit.
<li>The negative power supply has a range of 0 to -9 V and 0 to -1.5 A current limit.
<li>The reference voltage supplies can provide only limited current, up to 10 mA.
<li>The disabled reference voltage output is not in high impedance but should be close to zero volts.
</ul><br>
